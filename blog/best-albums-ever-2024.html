    </div>
    <div class="bodycontent">
        <p>Inspired by <a href="https://100best.music.apple.com/">Apple Music 100 Best Albums</a> (and my <a
                href="../media-diet.html">own recent
                recommendations</a>), I got to thinking this morning about what would top <em>my</em> list of best
            albums.</p>
        <p>After a bit of a think, I realized that while I'm not sure I could compile a list I felt good about of such
            disparate eras, genres, and contexts... this is <em>my</em> list and I can do whatever I want!</p>
        <p>So, in part one of a (undetermined number here)-part series, please enjoy... the best Punk and Ska albums...
            ever. (In my opinion, of course.)</p>
        <hr>
        <p>Amongst the Top 5 in this category, I tried to offer a blend of what "punk" has meant across decades,
            personal / political / historical contexts, and state lines. Here, you'll find a blend of punk, hardcore,
            pop-punk, and ska; each sound</p>

                <br><small>Bad Brains</small>
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>It is hard to overstate how the music and culture of Jamaica have impacted my tastes in music, both directly
            and indirectly. It is also hard to overstate how, at the origins of seemingly every genre of music, there
            are Black artists that often receive too little credit for their contributions. To me, Bad Brains are an
            example of both.</p>
        <p>Formed as a jazz fusion band in 1979, Bad Brains would switch genres to punk, help establish the sound and
            scene of DC hardcore, and be banned by many venues by 1980, when they would move to NYC to play CBGB, the
            venue popularized by The Ramones, Blondie, and Jayne County. The impression Bad Brains would leave behind in
            DC is immense; Teen Idles / Minor Threat would form in 1979 / 1980 after watching them play, and Henry
            Rollins would join Black Flag in 1981, paving the way for the popularization of this new era: hardcore.</p>
        <p>At the same time, Bad Brains were testing the waters stateside for a movement that was well on its way in
            England: infusing punk music with Jamaican roots. At the same time The Specials were releasing their
            self-titled album that launched the second wave of ska (Two-Tone), Bad Brains adopted Rastafari and used
            their music to help spread its religious message of liberation for the African diaspora. Bad Brains deserves
            recognition as pioneers across genres and movements, and to this day I smile every time I see their version
            of <a href=‚Äúhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tower_(tarot_card)‚Äù>The Tower</a>.</p>

            </p>
        </div>
        <p>NOFX is the worst band I consider a favorite; NOFX has the worst fans in the world.</p>
        <p>Now that that‚Äôs out of the way, I consider The Decline to be the magnum opus of skate punk, the genre most
            are familiar with from Tony Hawk‚Äôs Pro Skater games. An 18-minute song, The Decline outlines political
            frustrations the band had living in the United States a year before Bush would be president and two years
            before 9/11. The prescience exhibited by The Decline is astonishing; the same band that would be start
            PunkVoter and Rock against Bush shows that they were concerned about many of the same issues during a
            Clinton Presidency.</p>
        <p>Sonically, the project is also ambitious; the most ambitious project NOFX had, or would ever release. From
            skate punk to the sounds of war, the band uses each movement of the song to evoke not just sounds, but
            soundscapes that illustrate the dread and anger the lyrics espouse. No wonder it inspired an <a

            Transgender Dysphoria Blues (TDB), to me, is the epitome of punk. Released in 2014, TDB marks a significant
            moment for Against Me!, vocalist Laura Jane Grace, and the scene as a whole. She announced her transition in
            a
            <a
                href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/the-secret-life-of-transgender-rocker-laura-jane-grace-tom-gabel-99788/">Rolling
                Stone article</a>
            two years earlier, the first time many folks in the Warped Tour crowd would engage
            the
            terms ‚Äútransgender‚Äù, ‚Äúdysphoria‚Äù, or ‚Äútransition‚Äù.
        </p>
        <p>
            As such, to me TDB is the epitome of what punk is meant to be. Its urgency, message, and tone all point to a
            subculture unknown to many whose populous have been here and have been mistreated for eons. It became a
            rallying
            cry for trans youth in the scene, and a wake up call for the rest of us.</p>
        <p>
            Ten years on, the album hits just as hard as it did in 2014; we may all be familiar with the concepts now,
            but
            there are still only a minority of folks willing to extend love, compassion, and protection to the trans
            community.</p>
