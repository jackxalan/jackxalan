            <![CDATA[ <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vexillology">Vexillology</a>, or the study of flag design, seems to have taken the internet by storm over the last decade, and has become a serious hobbyist interest. In every corner of the US, it seems like we&#8217;ve heard of a recent flag redesign. From <a href="http://www.mdah.ms.gov/taxonomy/term/131">Mississippi</a> to <a href="https://flag.utah.gov/">Utah</a> to <a href="https://www.sos.state.mn.us/about-the-office/news-room/sec-simon-s-statement-on-state-flag/">Minnesota</a>, states are leaving behind some dated, problematic icons of the past to embrace this new wave of interest in design.</p>
            <p>This &#8220;new wave&#8221; of flag design is primarily based upon guidelines identified by the North American Vexillological Association publication <a href="https://nava.org/good-flag-bad-flag">Good Flag, Bad Flag</a>. The &#8220;Five Principles&#8221; outlined in that publication are:</p>
            <ol>
            <li>Keep It Simple</li>
            <li>Use Meaningful Symbolism</li>
            <li>Use 2 or 3 Basic Colors</li>
            <li>No Lettering or Seals</li>
            <li>Be Destinctive or Be Related</li>
            </ol>
            <p>While these rules do tend to mesh with iconic flag designs, the contemporary flags being designed to fit exclusively within these principles have more recently been receiving critiques of their own.</p>
            <iframe class="yt-embd" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kRtUiORUh7c?si=KkEXmtqnXmQmVahk" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <hr />
            <p>A few years back, the city of Anaheim, California was hoping to do the same. At the time, they had what some considered to possibly be the <strong>worst</strong> flag design <em>ever</em>.</p>
            <img src="/images/old-anaheim-flag.svg.png" alt="" />
            <p>The original designer, Howard &#8220;Bud&#8221; Nagel, was the Public Information Officer for Anaheim in the 60s. As such, artistry and thoughtful composition didn&#8217;t seem to be a priority.</p>
            <p>In 2018, the city sought designs from artists to re-think its flag; I threw my hat in!</p>
            <p>At the time, I had been living in Anaheim for 4&#8211;5 years; it had really become my home-away-from home. Outside of Disneyland, I truly loved spending time downtown on Center St. Promenade, which had been drastically reimagined in the five years prior. Local business had taken over, with everything from a comic book store (RIP Pop!) to a traditional Japanese bakery.git-</p>
            <p>The real draw for non-locals, though, was the <a href="https://www.anaheimpackingdistrict.com/">Anaheim Packing District</a>, one of the earliest food halls to become successful in SoCal. It opened in 2014 in the shell of the former Sunkist citrus packing house, a reminder that before fairy tales and mice arrived in Anaheim, citrus farming defined the region. Stories of the orange groves are plentiful in discussions of Disneyland&#8217;s past; and while it may not be the seat of Orange County, Anaheim is probably the most well-known metropolis for anyone not familiar.</p>
            <p>This line of thinking, then, brought me to an obvious conclusion and design inspiration. For my design, I used a similar &#8220;silhouette&#8221;, if you will, to the old design - two bars above and below a central image. For the image itself, I tried to play with the concept of an orange that would <em>read</em> as an orange while still fitting within the principles outlined above. (Admittedly, I was enamored with those five principles then, an attitude I don&#8217;t necessarily still keep.)</p>
            <img src="/images/anaheim-flag.png" alt="" />
            <p>While there would be things I would do differently today (retain more detail in the orange like Mississippi&#8217;s flower opposed to attempting a Canada-esque silhouette), I still really enjoy this design! It&#8217;s one of my favorite pieces of design-work over the years, and perhaps my favorite flag I&#8217;ve done.</p>
            <hr />
            <p>Ultimately, though, I wouldn&#8217;t be chosen. The winning design is more reminiscent of flags like Washington, D.C.&#8217;s or Chicago&#8217;s - too much, in my opinion.</p>
            <img src="/images/alternate-anaheim-flag.png" alt="" />
            <p>I wish there was a bit more spirit in the design, and perhaps city officials thought so too, as Anaheim chose to revert back to its original in 2019. For all that effort, the &#8220;new&#8221; flag lasted less than a year.</p>]]>

            <![CDATA[ <p class="p1"><span class="s1">I’ve always liked taking pictures.</span></p>
            <p class="p1"><span class="s1">When I was a kid, I
                would enter ten photos every summer to be judged
                in our local 4-H fair. I never won a big prize or
                advanced to the State Fair, but I enjoyed it and
                kept going. Looking back now, I think my photos
                and their grades are pretty telling of how I have
                approached photography over the years.</span></p>
            <p class="p1"><span class="s1">When I was a kid, I
                think I believed that photos needed to be of
                something impressive, that the goal of a photo
                was
                to communicate that I, the photographer, had been
                somewhere or done something interesting. The
                photo
                was more or less “look where I have been.”</span>
            </p>
            <img
                src="https://jackcummings.me/images/btmrr.jpg">
            <p class="caption">Wow! Look! I caught
                a
                train coming through at Big Thunder Mountain
                Railroad! (Walt Disney World)</p>
            <p class="p1"><span class="s1">I remember being
                impressed with myself for taking a photo at a
                Cincinnati Reds game, catching the ball in
                mid-flight as it raced from the pitcher toward
                home. The shot itself was wide, as it was taken
                from the stands and we didn’t have a particularly
                large lens with which to zoom, and the colors
                were
                only tinted by the film we used (probably the
                cheapest cache on the wall in Wal-Mart). This, to
                me, was peak photography - I had been somewhere
                fun and had caught an impressive sight with the
                camera.</span></p>
            <p class="p1"><span class="s1">In college, this
                would shift slightly.</span></p>
            <iframe class="yt-embd" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/H-QEAHgYc6g?si=v-ID-4bownh7fXZb" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <p class="p1"><span class="s1">In 2009, I met a
                girl
                I would marry eight years later, and she got me
                into this band called The Wonder Years. In 2011,
                they would release a single called Local Man
                Ruins
                Everything in advance of the album Suburbia, I’ve
                Given You All and Now I’m Nothing. The album
                would
                be a love letter of sorts to smaller residences
                in
                the Midwest; while the lyrics paint a very clear
                picture of the Philadelphia suburbs, small towns
                in the Midwest have similar vibes and it was easy
                to apply the narrative to a little place in
                Indiana. The record would be promoted with
                pictures and videos shot in South Philly, in
                areas
                highlighting its mundaneness.</span></p>
            <p class="p1"><span class="s1">This perspective
                caught my attention - here was photography
                focused
                on the anthesis of what I believed made a good
                photo, and it could be done in my backyard! When
                Instagram arrived the same year, my eye
                completely
                changed. Now, I was looking for mundane magic -
                moments that were so normal to me that, in
                retrospect, revealed a certain beauty.</span></p>
            <img
                src="https://jackcummings.me/images/instatrain.JPG">
            <p class="caption">My first image on
                Instagram in 2011</p>
            <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Over the years, I
                would waffle between shooting subjects fairly
                clinically, showcasing only the subject itself
                with no supporting elements, to delving back into
                this interest in artistic interpretations of the
                mundane, composing an image of the everyday to
                capture its beauty.</span></p>
            <p class="p1"><span class="s1">I suppose this
                fanciful flight between interests was best
                captured on my <a href="https://iamcalledjack.tumblr.com">Tumblr</a>, where I would scour the
                tags across the platform compiling images that
                suited my mood in the moment.</span></p>
            <p class="p1"><span class="s1">The biggest obstacle
                in my journey towards better photos is, looking
                back, perhaps unintuitive; I spent so much time
                at
                Disney Parks, where so much is perfectly
                photogenic and colorful on its own. I never
                needed to think “outside the box” to capture a
                moment, instead being able to capture picture
                perfect subject at anytime. (See BTMRR above as
                an example.)</span></p>
            <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Still, there was
                always an itch to improve, to capture moments, to
                improve my compositional eye.</span></p>
            <img
                src="https://jackcummings.me/images/birdsandtwain.jpeg">
            <p class="caption">While not a perfect photo, I
                return to this often because of the moment - the
                feeling and sight of seeing so many birds fly
                perfectly overhead.</p>
            <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Recently, I’ve tried
                to begin learning how to break out of my normal
                mode of taking &amp; editing photos, thanks to
                some guidance from “Photography YouTube.”There,
                creators share (for free!) tips that could easily
                be curated into a class, making ”studying” easy
                and fun.</span></p>

            <p class="caption">Downloading Halide
                to shoot and editing using Darkroom per Stalman’s
                advice is where my journey truly started over the
                last year.</p>

            <p class="caption">I really love
                James’s relaxed style of presentation, and this
                composition video (along with his more recent
                “Exposure Myth” video) has really helped me to
                start thinking differently about how I want to
                shoot intentionally.</p>

            <p class="caption">An old photo from
                Joshua Tree I edited recently to try to
                incorporate some of the lessons I learned from
                the videos above</p>
            <p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the coming year,
                I hope to really turn photography into a hobby. I
                miss running around Disneyland, taking pictures
                of sights big and small that caught my eye.
                What’s to say I can’t do the same with the
                seemingly infinite charm found in the smallest
                pockets of New England?</span></p>
            <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Until then, keep
                learning. Go find your spark.</span></p>
