    <h3>Guided Tours Garden</h3>
    Good morning, everyone! My name is Jack and and I’d like to invite you to join me for one final Guided Tour. I will be your guide one last time as I share how you and this magical place have truly changed my life forever.<br><br>
One of the countless things that makes this place so unique is how it continues to imbue in all of us the traits that forged our favorite storyteller (and our very first tour guide) Walt Disney. Disneyland is a place of inspiration, of limitless potential; it allows us to explore our world and our most inner selves, and to share in dreams that we look forward to realizing in the most terrific future… But more than this, I think there is a more important truth: as we adventure toward endless frontiers dreaming of the future, we do so <strong>together.</strong> 
<br><br>So now, together, let us take one final walk through Walt Disney’s Magic Kingdom, Disneyland U.S.A.<br><br>
    <h3>Town Square</h3>
    <blockquote class="onelasttour">“To all who come to this happy place, welcome.”</blockquote>
    With these words on July 17, 1955, Walt Disney changed the world. While the decades since that day haven’t been perfect and society has been beset by trials and tribulations, Main Street, U.S.A. has stood as a message and an ideal: regardless of origin, here at Disneyland, you are welcome. From that very first day, Main Street has been a reflection of what I believe Walt may have seen as his interpretation of the American dream. In his own way, he gave us a place where <em>“huddled masses yearning to breathe free”</em> might free themselves from their troubles, even if for a day or just a moment. 
<br><br>As we know, that first day wasn’t freedom from trouble for Disneyland or for Walt. The street that surrounds us became an allegory for what many feared might happen: just as guests’ high heels were sinking into the pavement, so too was the prospect of Disneyland’s success. The media was quick to write off Walt’s dream as naïve and unobtainable; but, as we know, hope is the foundation of persistence and Walt Disney was of the most hopeful of his time.
<br><br>In our time at Disneyland, we have all known triumph and failure. We’ve seen the best of what humankind has to offer, and we’ve had days that question our faith in the dream, and our hope for the future. So I invite you now, as we continue on to the heart of Disneyland, to free yourself of your troubles and doubts, even if for just a moment. Think of where you are, think of the millions that have been here before, and remember: no matter what, <strong><em>this is a happy place and here you are welcome.</em></strong><br><br>
    <h3>Central Plaza</h3>
    Welcome to the heart of Disneyland, the Central Plaza. As we know, the Central Plaza exists as a conjunction of Disneyland’s arteries: the paths and portals from which all of our Magic Kingdom’s ideals become real. Walt’s idea for this “Hub” sprung from fatigue: as he visited museums and other public places, he tired of returning to the same place again and again just to move forward. For Disneyland, he dreamt of a place for guests to center themselves - a place where they might never be lost and where it was always easy to find their north star. (You know, the second one to the right.)
    <br><br>I find it fitting that alongside Sleeping Beauty Castle, a star of of sorts - a compass - resides near the center of Disneyland, always pointing north… and surrounding it, lyrics with which we are all intimately familiar:
<blockquote>“When you wish upon a star, your dreams come true.”</blockquote>
We all know that line from the 1940 classic Pinocchio, where Jiminy Cricket serves as Pinocchio’s north star: his conscience. Pinocchio learned rather quickly that doing the right thing was often the more difficult decision. Again and again Jiminy would offer his advice, returning to principles he knew would lead Pinocchio back home, so that he might not lose his way. It may have been tiresome to hear, but in the end… Pinocchio learned what it meant to be a “real person”: <strong>you make mistakes, you grow from them, and you allow that experience to shape your moral compass, ever pointing towards your own north star.</strong><br><br>
    <h3>"it's a small world"</h3>
    In 1955, Disneyland introduced America to some of Walt Disney’s most closely-held beliefs, hopes, and dreams. Less than a decade later, Walt would endeavor to introduce those ideals to the world. In 1964, WED Enterprises (a private firm owned wholly by Walt himself) opened four unique attractions for the New York World’s Fair: the Carousel of Progress, Ford’s Magic Skyway, Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln, and of course… “it’s a small world”.  Nearing what would be the end of his time with us, Walt wanted to give back what he had been given. Disneyland had been inspired by the “real world” from the beginning; and now, Disneyland would inspire the “real world.” Two of the park’s founding beliefs would be reflected in the attractions developed for the Fair: progress and unity. The idea that a “theme park ride” could <em>“foster a better understanding among nations of the world”</em> was revolutionary and continues to be relevant today and important for tomorrow.
    <br><br>Now, in my final moments as a denizen of the “Happiest Place on Earth”, as I leave these realms of <em>“yesterday, tomorrow and fantasy”</em> for that “real world,” I hope to take with me my greatest inspiration from this magical place: you. 
    <br><br>Six years ago, you welcomed me with open arms, and invited me to join a truly special family, clad in a tartan I will proudly wear (in other forms) for decades. From you, I learned the powers of empathy, passion, and confidence. You pushed me to be better, and supported me when I failed. You all have been my compass, my north star, and I hope I’ve done right by you along the way and made you proud. <strong>Thank you for everything.</strong>
    <br><br>I had a dream, and without you all it would have been just a start.
    <br>Thank you for guiding me to follow it with mind and heart.
    <br>Thank you for allowing my dream to become a reality.

    <br><br>It’s been a dream come true and an honor to be a Disneyland Tour Guide; and as always…

    <br><br><strong><em>“It’s been my pleasure.”</em></strong> Thank you all so much. I love you and I’ll miss you.
