<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Attempted Photography</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I’ve always liked taking pictures.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When I was a kid, I would enter ten photos every summer to be judged in our local 4-H fair. I never won a big prize or advanced to the State Fair, but I enjoyed it and kept going. Looking back now, I think my photos and their grades are pretty telling of how I have approached photography over the years.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When I was a kid, I think I believed that photos needed to be of something impressive, that the goal of a photo was to communicate that I, the photographer, had been somewhere or done something interesting. The photo was more or less “look where I have been.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Wow! Look! I caught a train coming through at Big Thunder Mountain Railroad! (Walt Disney World)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I remember being impressed with myself for taking a photo at a Cincinnati Reds game, catching the ball in mid-flight as it raced from the pitcher toward home. The shot itself was wide, as it was taken from the stands and we didn’t have a particularly large lens with which to zoom, and the colors were only tinted by the film we used (probably the cheapest cache on the wall in Wal-Mart). This, to me, was peak photography - I had been somewhere fun and had caught an impressive sight with the camera.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In college, this would shift slightly.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In 2009, I met a girl I would marry eight years later, and she got me into this band called The Wonder Years. In 2011, they would release a single called Local Man Ruins Everything in advance of the album Suburbia, I’ve Given You All and Now I’m Nothing. The album would be a love letter of sorts to smaller residences in the Midwest; while the lyrics paint a very clear picture of the Philadelphia suburbs, small towns in the Midwest have similar vibes and it was easy to apply the narrative to a little place in Indiana. The record would be promoted with pictures and videos shot in South Philly, in areas highlighting its mundaneness.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This perspective caught my attention - here was photography focused on the anthesis of what I believed made a good photo, and it could be done in my backyard! When Instagram arrived the same year, my eye completely changed. Now, I was looking for mundane magic - moments that were so normal to me that, in retrospect, revealed a certain beauty.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">My first post on Instagram in 2011</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Over the years, I would waffle between shooting subjects fairly clinically, showcasing only the subject itself with no supporting elements, to delving back into this interest in artistic interpretations of the mundane, composing an image of the everyday to capture its beauty.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I suppose this fanciful flight between interests was best captured on my Tumblr, where I would scour the tags across the platform compiling images that suited my mood in the moment.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The biggest obstacle in my journey towards better photos is, looking back, perhaps unintuitive; I spent so much time at Disney Parks, where so much is perfectly photogenic and colorful on its own, I never needed to think “outside the box” to capture a moment, instead being able to capture picture</span></p>
