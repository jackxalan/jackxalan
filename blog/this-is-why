## Paramore's 2023 Album of the Year
##### [Jack Cummings](https://jackcummings.me) •

In 2007, misogyny was king. Unfortunately.

My earliest memory of Paramore is that they were my friend's favorite band. (A friend that I would have tried to date if she hadn't already dated 2... 3? of my other friends and I hadn't already sworn off dating until college. That's probably relevant somehow.) At the time, it seemed like we all had "our band" - a band that was ours, that no one else could *really* claim. (Gatekeeping? That's **definitely** relevant to this conversation. I had Family Force 5, a girl a few grades above us had Fall Out Boy (also also relevant; are you taking notes?), and my best friend had Avenged Sevenfold.

As such, Paramore was *her* band. A *girl's* band. While none of us would outwardly admit it, we enjoyed Riot! (Paramore's second album) a ton, but would *never* admit them as one of our favorites; because they were for girls, see? This exact issue played out a couple of years earlier with Fall Out Boy. The whole carload of us would sing every chorus of every single of their first three albums word for word, but there was *no way* they were one of our favorite bands. 

> I had this weird relationship with a lot of music in high school, for various reasons. I "hated rap" but loved Kanye's 808 and Heartbreaks, Punk Goes Crunk, and... Family Force 5. (I'll give you one guess as to what problematic reason was behind this one. Did you guess internalized racism? 🛎️)

Still, Riot! was a classic, as we would all recognize in the years to come. Every. Single. Song. No problems *anywhere*.

<sub><sup>Okay fine, let's talk about Misery Business.</sup></sub>

Misery Business, to this day, is one of the hardest-hitting songs to come out of the Warped scene. The drums come in flying, the riffs will punch through the posters on your bedroom wall... It is a certified **banger**. But, once again... 

In 2007, misogyny was king. Unfortunately. 

While everyone immediately points to Hayley Williams's (the lead vocalist) use of the word "whore" in the back half of the song, the whole track is enveloped in the culture of sl*t-shaming that was commonplace amongst teens in the aughts. Just like we were (are, TBH) accustomed to downplaying culture made for and by young women, we would only accept desire from Hayley and others like her if they were willing to tear down other women in the same breath. 

That mentality was unacceptable then, and it's unacceptable now. 

After a decade of Miz Biz and a career that allowed the band to reclaim some agency in their work, Hayley and co. would retire the song in 2018. It was a sign that thankfully, the scene had grown in a way that understood the inherent misogyny the song represented, and was willing to hang it up to show support from the women alongside them in the pit. For now. 📌

After Riot!, Paramore would release three albums that make up the foundation of their fanbase's current love of the band: Brand New Eyes (my favorite), Paramore (self-titled), and After Laughter. 

> To be honest, I fell off around their self-titled era in 2013. I had moved to California, the spiritual home of pop-punk, and would spend the next few years entrenching myself in the sounds of dudes from the coast. (Also, I spent the majority of my free time in 2013 running around Disneyland and wasn't actively seeking out new music). By the time After Laughter rolled around, it's 80's-new-wave-inspired sound just wasn't my thing. Seeing them live turned that around, though. 

For the next seven or so years, I wouldn't count Paramore as a favorite band. I would spin Brand New Eyes every now and then, but that was about it. I even stopped listening to Riot! for the most part because of the Miz Biz guilt and... another reason. 📌 

**But!** Miss Williams (if ya nasty) would be in my speaker *plenty* thanks to what has become one of my favorite songs *ever* (on one of my favorite albums, to boot).

Fast forward to 2022.
