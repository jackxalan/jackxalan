<h1>(UPDATE) MY DISNEY CAREER</h1>
<h5><a href="https://jackcummings.me">Jack Cummings</a> • 05.03.24</h5>
<hr>

<p> In trying to make my “career” posts a bit more lively and to add some fun breaks to my “resume” page, I thought I would include some pictures where I can of my different gigs over the years. While these are nowhere near my favorite pictures, these moments can help illustrate some of the wildest days I had on tour.<br><br>

<img src="../images/walts-apt-tour.jpg" alt="A posed photo of me inside Walt’s Apartment">
<p class="caption">It’s well known amongst Disneyland’s fans that Walt Disney had an apartment on Main Street; we got to share it with folks everyday on a Guided Tour. Getting to see folks visit a place that meant this much to them is an honor I won’t soon forget.</p>
<br>
<img alt="Me, leading a VIP Tour down Main Street" src="../images/ro-tour-guide-video.png">
<p class="caption">From <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc4J8ok0S_Y">Rosanna Pansino’s video</a> of her trip to Disneyland with some friends; the highs and lows she captured pretty well make up what it’s like to be on tour.</p>
<br>
<img src="../images/tros-blue-carpet.jpg" alt="Me at The Rise of Skywalker premiere">
<p class="caption">While this wasn’t the <strong>most</strong> surreal Star Wars experience I would have that year… (thank you, Galaxy’s Edge’s Opening Ceremony) It was still pretty incredible.</p>

While it’s so fun to reminisce, I can’t overstate how homesick going through old tour photos makes me. Every beloved friend I see in pictures is a gut punch, every mentor and mentee an uppercut to the jaw. I miss these folks terribly, and it tears me up that I don’t know when I’ll see all of them next.<br><br>

If you’re reading this, love y’all. Miss you. I still mean every word I wrote in my <a href="../blog/one-last-tour.html">goodbye tour</a>.
