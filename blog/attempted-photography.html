  <h1>ATTEMPTED PHOTOGRAPHY</h1>
  <h5><a href="https://jackcummings.me">Jack Cummings</a> &#8226;
   01.01.24</h5>
   <p class="p1"><span class="s1">I’ve always liked
     taking pictures.</span></p>
   <p class="p1"><span class="s1">When I was a kid, I
     would enter ten photos every summer to be judged
     in our local 4-H fair. I never won a big prize or
     advanced to the State Fair, but I enjoyed it and
     kept going. Looking back now, I think my photos
     and their grades are pretty telling of how I have
     approached photography over the years.</span></p>
   <p class="p1"><span class="s1">When I was a kid, I
     think I believed that photos needed to be of
     something impressive, that the goal of a photo
     was
     to communicate that I, the photographer, had been
     somewhere or done something interesting. The
     photo
     was more or less “look where I have been.”</span>
   </p>
   <img

   <p class="caption">Wow! Look! I caught
    a
    train coming through at Big Thunder Mountain
    Railroad! (Walt Disney World)</p>
   <p class="p1"><span class="s1">I remember being
     impressed with myself for taking a photo at a
     Cincinnati Reds game, catching the ball in
     mid-flight as it raced from the pitcher toward
     home. The shot itself was wide, as it was taken
     from the stands and we didn’t have a particularly
     large lens with which to zoom, and the colors
     were
     only tinted by the film we used (probably the
     cheapest cache on the wall in Wal-Mart). This, to
     me, was peak photography - I had been somewhere
     fun and had caught an impressive sight with the
     camera.</span></p>
   <p class="p1"><span class="s1">In college, this
     would shift slightly.</span></p>

   <p class="p1"><span class="s1">In 2009, I met a
     girl
     I would marry eight years later, and she got me
     into this band called The Wonder Years. In 2011,
     they would release a single called Local Man
     Ruins
     Everything in advance of the album Suburbia, I’ve
     Given You All and Now I’m Nothing. The album
     would
     be a love letter of sorts to smaller residences
     in
     the Midwest; while the lyrics paint a very clear
     picture of the Philadelphia suburbs, small towns
     in the Midwest have similar vibes and it was easy
     to apply the narrative to a little place in
     Indiana. The record would be promoted with
     pictures and videos shot in South Philly, in
     areas
     highlighting its mundaneness.</span></p>
   <p class="p1"><span class="s1">This perspective
     caught my attention - here was photography
     focused
     on the anthesis of what I believed made a good
     photo, and it could be done in my backyard! When
     Instagram arrived the same year, my eye
     completely
     changed. Now, I was looking for mundane magic -
     moments that were so normal to me that, in
     retrospect, revealed a certain beauty.</span></p>

   <p class="caption">My first image on
    Instagram in 2011</p>
   <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Over the years, I
     would waffle between shooting subjects fairly
     clinically, showcasing only the subject itself
     with no supporting elements, to delving back into
     this interest in artistic interpretations of the
     mundane, composing an image of the everyday to
     capture its beauty.</span></p>
   <p class="p1"><span class="s1">I suppose this
     fanciful flight between interests was best
     captured on my <a href="https://iamcalledjack.tumblr.com">Tumblr</a>, where I would scour the
     tags across the platform compiling images that
     suited my mood in the moment.</span></p>
   <p class="p1"><span class="s1">The biggest obstacle
     in my journey towards better photos is, looking
     back, perhaps unintuitive; I spent so much time
     at
     Disney Parks, where so much is perfectly
     photogenic and colorful on its own. I never
     needed to think “outside the box” to capture a
     moment, instead being able to capture picture
     perfect subject at anytime. (See BTMRR above as
     an example.)</span></p>
   <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Still, there was
     always an itch to improve, to capture moments, to
     improve my compositional eye.</span></p>
   <img

   <p class="caption">While not a perfect photo, I
    return to this often because of the moment - the
    feeling and sight of seeing so many birds fly
    perfectly overhead.</p>
   <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Recently, I’ve tried
     to begin learning how to break out of my normal
     mode of taking &amp; editing photos, thanks to
     some guidance from “Photography YouTube.”There,
     creators share (for free!) tips that could easily
     be curated into a class, making ”studying” easy
     and fun.</span></p>

   <p class="caption">Downloading Halide
     to shoot and editing using Darkroom per Stalman’s
     advice is where my journey truly started over the
     last year.</p>

   <p class="caption">I really love
     James’s relaxed style of presentation, and this
     composition video (along with his more recent
     “Exposure Myth” video) has really helped me to
     start thinking differently about how I want to
     shoot intentionally.</p>

   <p class="caption">An old photo from
    Joshua Tree I edited recently to try to
    incorporate some of the lessons I learned from
    the videos above</p>
   <p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the coming year,
     I hope to really turn photography into a hobby. I
     miss running around Disneyland, taking pictures
     of sights big and small that caught my eye.
     What’s to say I can’t do the same with the
     seemingly infinite charm found in the smallest
     pockets of New England?</span></p>
   <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Until then, keep
     learning. Go find your spark.</span></p>

    favorite picture I’d ever taken, it might be this
    one. Thanks to some new editing tricks, I now love it even more.</p>
